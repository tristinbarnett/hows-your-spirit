## Description
How’s Your Spirit? (HYS?) is a mood causality tracker that was designed with ease of use, and actionable information at its core.

With HYS? you are able to use our intuitive interface to capture your moods and daily activities. These factors can then be reviewed via an easy to reference UI that visualizes the frequency and intensity of your moods, energy level, and activities that affect them; both positive and negative.
